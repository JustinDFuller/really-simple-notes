## What's Simple?

- Text-based, no formatting.
- Offline-first, no network lag while typing (ever).
- Installable [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)
- Limited options
  - Limited depth trees (2 folders)
  - Title is the first line of the file
- Loads incredibly fast
  - All styles and scripts inlined
  - Total file size is less than React by itself

## Why?

I have a few issues with other notes apps.

1. Too much formatting distracts me from what's important, writing notes.
2. I love Coda and Notion's file tree, but unlimited depth actually makes things harder because I fiddle with the folder structure too much.
3. Some apps, such as Coda, are incredibly slow on mobile and on bad networks.
4. Some apps reduce formatting but don't eliminate it, resulting in a really frustrating experience.
